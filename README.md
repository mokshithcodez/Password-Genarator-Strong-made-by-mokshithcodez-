# 🔑 Password Generator

Welcome to the **Password Generator** project! 🎉 This Python-based tool generates secure, randomized passwords and even speaks to you using text-to-speech! 🗣️✨

## 🌟 Features
- 🔒 **Randomized Passwords**: Combines uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and even numbers to create strong passwords.
- ✨ **Customizable Length**: Choose the number of characters for your password.
- 🗣️ **Text-to-Speech**: Hear the app greet you and announce your generated password.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. The program will greet you and ask how many characters you want in your password.
3. A secure password is generated and spoken aloud! 🎧

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pyttsx3
```

## 💻 Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mokshithcodez/Password-Genarator-Strong-made-by-mokshithcodez-.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd password-generator
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Enter the desired password length when prompted.

## 📄 Code Overview
Here's the core logic of the project:
- Combines alphabets (uppercase and lowercase) and even numbers into a pool.
- Uses `random.sample` to generate a password of the specified length.
- Integrates `pyttsx3` to add voice output.

## 🎨 Example Output
```plaintext

Number of Digits: 10
Generated Password: aZ2M8q4Bk0
```
